A hello-world'ish Python3 Flask application that simply maps [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language codes to translations of 'Merry christmas' and serves it as JSON.

## Usage
Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

```bash
# For development, run the application at port 5000 with:
python3 wsgi.py

# For production, run it using gunicorn with:
gunicorn -w <WORKERS> -b <HOST>:<PORT> wsgi

# To get access log printed to standed out, run with:
gunicorn -w <WORKERS> -b <HOST>:<PORT> --access-logfile - wsgi
```

Now you can find a bunch of nice translations at `localhost:<PORT>/lw/xmas/<TARGET_LANGUAGE>`.
```bash
curl localhost:<PORT>/lw/xmas/de
```

The supported language codes are: *cs, da, de, el, en, es, it, nl, pl, ru*
